# TextToEmoji
This is a simple text to emoji classification model. 
I have used a sample dataset from kaggle that currently works on only 5 emojis. You're free to train your model to a variety of emojis. 
Tips:- Dont forget to install emojis library using pip install emoji.
       For embeddings, install glove packages
